The project contains the sample code used for web api sessions

## Instructions

To run the api server execute
`python3 app.py` or `python app.py` if your system python binary points to python3

## Troubleshooting
If you get module not found errors execute the following
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You may need to replace `pip` in the above command by `pip3` to explicitly install python3 packages.
In case of any other errors let us know.
